# Internship-Task-1-Ad-Performance
This repository showcases my first internship task, where we analyzed ad campaign performance using Excel, Pivot Tables, and Charts. The goal was to evaluate campaign effectiveness, identify low-performing ads, and suggest improvements.  Key Outcomes: Highlighted ads to discontinue due to poor performance.
